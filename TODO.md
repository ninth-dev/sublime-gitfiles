# TODO

For **GitFiles: Goto**:
- Add deleted files to the list of files, maybe as an additional setting ?
- on highlight: do nothing
- on selected: do nothing / show

For **GitFiles: Next / Prev Modifications**:
- Current implementation is not optimized
- Maybe a different data structure, like a linked list
- Maybe add some caching -- if pressed within X seconds
  - calls `git status` each time
